AdventureWorks Sales & Profit Analysis
ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project analyzes AdventureWorks sales data to provide insights on revenue, profit, and customer behavior from May 2011 to June 2014. The goal is to identify key trends, top-performing products, and sales patterns across regions and time, supporting better decision-making.

ðŸ—‚ Dataset

Source: Kaggle â€“ AdventureWorks

Structure: Multiple related tables including SalesOrderHeader, SalesOrderDetail, Product, ProductCategory, ProductSubcategory, Customer, and SalesTerritory.

Record Counts: From small lookup tables (4â€“37 rows) to large transactional tables (up to 121,000 rows).

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

Excel â€“ Data cleaning and removal of irrelevant columns

Python (pandas) â€“ Data wrangling, handling nulls, type conversions, and exporting clean CSVs

SQL (Azure Data Studio / MySQL Workbench) â€“ Exploratory queries and aggregations

Power BI â€“ Dashboard creation with relationships, DAX measures, and time intelligence functions

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Wrangling

Removed high-null or irrelevant columns (e.g., StoreID, SalesPersonID, DiscontinuedDate)

Converted data types for consistency

Filled missing values appropriately

Preserved relationships via primary keys

Removed duplicates

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

Total Orders: 31,465 placed; 27,659 successfully delivered

Revenue: $123.22M, with the U.S. generating the highest share

Profit: â€“$44M due to heavy discounts and promotions

Top Products: Road Bikes & Mountain Bikes lead in sales but suffer from high profit loss

Seasonality: March shows peak revenue; June has the lowest

Yearly Trend: 2013 had the highest orders and revenue but also the largest loss

Data Modeling:

In the AdventureWorks project, the data model was designed by connecting key tables to create a logical and efficient relationship structure for analysis. The SalesOrderHeader table was linked to the Customer table through the CustomerID field, enabling customer-level insights. Product-related details flowed from the Product table, connected to ProductSubcategory, which in turn linked to ProductCategory for a clear product hierarchy. The SalesOrderDetail table acted as the transactional fact table, connecting with both SalesOrderHeader and Product tables to consolidate sales, quantity, and pricing data. Additionally, the Customer table was linked to the SalesTerritory table via TerritoryID, allowing geographic and regional performance analysis. This star-schema-like model ensures seamless filtering, accurate aggregation, and powerful analytics in Power BI.
